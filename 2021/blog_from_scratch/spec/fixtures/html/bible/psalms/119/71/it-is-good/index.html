    It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn YHVH's statutes.
    <i>Psalm 119:71</i>
  </section>

  <h1>It is good</h1>

<p>This is one of the first verses to catch my attention that maybe I&#39;m reading the book wrong. I was in the midst of affliction, but I did not consider it a good thing. However, I had experienced the sense of seeing good come from a difficult situation. I was deparate and was willing to try anything at the time. I didn&#39;t know YHVH&#39;s statutes, and I certainly didn&#39;t delight in them. I thought it may be worth a try to learn them if they were capable of bringing good out of a time of affliction. I am glad I took that posture. My life has forever changed for the better. It was good that I was afflicted.</p>
