# It is good

This is one of the first verses to catch my attention that maybe I'm reading the book wrong. I was in the midst of affliction, but I did not consider it a good thing. However, I had experienced the sense of seeing good come from a difficult situation. I was deparate and was willing to try anything at the time. I didn't know YHVH's statutes, and I certainly didn't delight in them. I thought it may be worth a try to learn them if they were capable of bringing good out of a time of affliction. I am glad I took that posture. My life has forever changed for the better. It was good that I was afflicted.
