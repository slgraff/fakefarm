# Flip Face Mask Irony 

I received a patent for a t-shirt concept that covers the face with a t-shirt. It was selling well to colleges and some t-shirt souvinere shops. However, when we tried to sell it to WalMart they said that it would be a liability to have children cover their faces with a t-shirt. Oh the irony.
