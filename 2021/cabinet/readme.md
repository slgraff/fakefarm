# Cabinet

Organize files and directories

I want to manage my life from the simplies of files and folders and yet incorporate todo lists, deadlines, summaries, that allow me to think big and small about my projects. I also want the computer to manage the mundane parts with simple scripts.

# Goals

- simple command line app
- use my favorite tools (sublime, iAwriter, bash)
- use all my languages to manage my life
