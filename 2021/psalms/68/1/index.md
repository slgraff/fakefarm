There are two stages here:
- Pre Arise
- Post Arise

- What is life to look like before YHVH arises?
- How are we to live differently than once YHVH arises.
- how long does YHVH sit?
- when will YHVH rise?
- what will it take for YHVH to rise?
- how long will YHVH rise?
- What will happen after YHVH rises?
- Will YHVH sit back down after rising?
- What other reasons will cause YHVH to rise?
- Is Yahushua standing at the right hand of YHVH the moment that this is speaking? Did Yahushua scatter His enemies when He completed the events surrounding His birth, death, burial, and resurrection?
