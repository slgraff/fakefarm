# Psalm 68

1
Let Elohim arise
Let YHVH Elohim's enemies shall be scattered
Let enemies who hate YHVH Elohim flee before YHVH Elohim!

2
As smoke is driven away, 
so YHVH shall drive them away!

As wax melts before fire,
so the wicked shall perish before Elohim!

3
But the righteous shall be glad;
they shall exult before Elohim;
they shall be jubilant with joy!

4
Sing to Elohim, sing praises to YHVH Elohim's name;
lift up a song to YHVH Elohim who rides through the deserts;
YHVH Elohim's name is the LORD;
exult before YHVH Elohim!

5
Father of the fatherless and protector of widows
is Elohim in YHVH Elohim's holy habitation.

6
Elohim settles the solitary in a home;
he leads out the prisoners to prosperity,
but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.

7
O Elohim, when you went out before your people,
when you marched through the wilderness, Selah

8
the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain,
before Elohim, the One of Sinai,
before Elohim, the Elohim of Israel.
9
Rain in abundance, O Elohim, you shed abroad;
you restored your inheritance as it languished;
10
your flock found a dwelling in it;
in your goodness, O Elohim, you provided for the needy.

11
YHVH gives the word;
the women who announce the news are a great host:
12
“The kings of the armies—they flee, they flee!”
The women at home divide the spoil—
13
though you men lie among the sheepfolds—
the wings of a dove covered with silver,
its pinions with shimmering gold.
14
When the Almighty scatters kings there,
let snow fall on Zalmon.

15
O mountain of Elohim, mountain of Bashan;
O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan!
16
Why do you look with hatred, O many-peaked mountain,
at the mount that Elohim desired for YHVH Elohim's abode,
yes, where the LORD will dwell forever?
17
The chariots of Elohim are twice ten thousand,
thousands upon thousands;
the Lord is among them; Sinai is now in the sanctuary.
18
You ascended on high,
leading a host of captives in your train
and receiving gifts among men,
even among the rebellious, that the LORD Elohim may dwell there.

19
Blessed be the Lord,
who daily bears us up;
Elohim is our salvation. Selah
20
Our Elohim is a Elohim of salvation,
and to GOD, the Lord, belong deliverances from death.
21
But Elohim will strike the heads of YHVH Elohim's enemies,
the hairy crown of YHVH Elohim who walks in YHVH Elohim's guilty ways.
22
YHVH said,
“I will bring them back from Bashan,
I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
23
that you may strike your feet in their blood,
that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from the foe.”

24
Your procession is seen, O Elohim,
the procession of my Elohim, my King, into the sanctuary—
25
the singers in front, the musicians last,
between them virgins playing tambourines:
26
“Bless Elohim in the great congregation,
the LORD, O you who are of Israel’s fountain!”
27
There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead,
the princes of Judah in their throng,
the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.

28
Summon your power, O Elohim,
the power, O Elohim, by which you have worked for us.
29
Because of your temple at Jerusalem
kings shall bear gifts to you.
30
Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds,
the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples.
Trample underfoot those who lust after tribute;
scatter the peoples who delight in war.
31
Nobles shall come from Egypt;
Cush shall hasten to stretch out her hands to Elohim.

32
O kingdoms of the earth, sing to Elohim;
sing praises to the Lord, Selah
33
to YHVH Elohim who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens;
behold, he sends out YHVH Elohim's voice, YHVH Elohim's mighty voice.
34
Ascribe power to Elohim,
whose majesty is over Israel,
and whose power is in the skies.
35
Awesome is Elohim from YHVH Elohim's sanctuary;
the Elohim of Israel—he is the one who gives power and strength to YHVH Elohim's people.
Blessed be Elohim!
