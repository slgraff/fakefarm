# Psalm 119

## Aleph
- 1 Blessed are those whose way is blameless. Who walk in the Torah of YHVH.
- 2 Blessed are those who keep YHVH's testamonies. Who seek YHVH with their whole heart.
- 3 Who also do no wrong. But walk in YHVH's ways.
- 4 YHVH has commanded YHVH's precepts to be kept diligently.
- 5 Oh that my ways may be steadfast in keeping YHVH's statutes!
- 6 Then I shall not be put to shame, having my eyes fixed on all YHVH's commandments.
- 7 I will praise YHVH with an upright heart, when I learn YHVH's righteous rules.
