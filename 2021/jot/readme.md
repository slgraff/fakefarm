Keep track of life's micro milestones

"Google the error message" is a luxary. Yet, I want to internalize my own education as well as track my professional progress. I'd like to see the kinds of issues I run into to tell if I can see a pattern of strength and weakness. 

I'd like to be able to log my searches for two reasons:
- to see if I google the same issue more than once
- to see what is my daily does of real-time ignorance
