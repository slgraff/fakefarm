<h1 id="origins">Origins</h1>

<h2 id="society">Society</h2>

<p>Who invented the idea of society? Is it a secular concept or a spiritual one? The only point of reference we have is the one we have. And since we have started life in a secular structure, it is easy to think that many of the concepts we take for granted are man's inventions. </p>

<h2 id="city">City</h2>

<p>A society exists around a structure. That structure is known as a city. Cities are another pillar of our existence which you might be tempted to think are credited to Man. Did man make the city, or did man instinctively do what He was created to do. That is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>be fruitful and multiply. </p>

<p>— Genesis 1:28</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="specificity">Specificity</h1>

<p>There is a spectrum when it comes to words on how specific or general they are. Christianity did not teach me about specific topics such as names, nations, lands, or cities. So when the specifics are names in scripture, they are glazed over as insignificant due the fact they are misunderstood. </p>

<p>Repetition is another concept that should be considered. The more something is repeated the more it is emphasized and should be adhered to. Take these specific words which are repeated constantly through scripture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YHVH loves the gates of Ziyyon more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</p>

<p>— Psalm 87</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ziyyon is a specific place with a specific purpose. It is both a physical place as well as a spiritual destination which YHVH will dwell and reign forever.</p>
