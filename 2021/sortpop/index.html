  I am learning how to listen to music that is not my own. It never was my own. There is a tradeoff. You can either cherish the little you have, or accept everything presented to you.

  I listen to music to make memories.

  Music makes memories. I listen to music with that mindset. I want to record a part of my life in a soundtrack format. Let's do some math.

  Let's say I create a seasonal playlist. Four playlists a year.
  I need to search, currate, and then commit. In that season I want to be able to:

  - record my life
  - have songs remind me of a season
  - call that my catalog that carries with me beyond a music subscription service.

  1 month of curration
  2 months of commitment
  4 times a year

  When do I listen?
  - mornings (25 songs)
  - work (100 songs)
  - after work solo ( 50 songs)
  - with friends socially (50 songs)
  - 225 songs a season
  - 900 song a year.
  - 30% greatest hits (70 songs)


  How to manage:
  -

  Goals:
  - I will know 225 songs by name
  - I will have 900 songs cataloged a year
  - 30% can be greatest hits
  - a journal page about events that happened in life.
