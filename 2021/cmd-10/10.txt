And YHVH Elohim spoke all these words, saying,

I AM YHVH thy Elohim,
who have brought thee out of the land of Mizrayim,
out of the house of bondage.

Thou shalt have no other gods beside YHVH.

Thou shalt not make for thyself any carved idol,
or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above,
or that is in the earth beneath,
or that is in the water under the earth.

Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor or serve them.

for I YHVH thy Elohim am a jealous Elohim,
punishing the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and the fourth generation of those who hate YHVH,

but showing mercy to thousands of generations of those who love YHVH and keep YHVH's commandments.

Thou shalt not take the name of YHVH thy Elohim in vain.
For YHVH will not hold him guiltless who takes YHVH's name in vain.

Remember the Sabbath day,
to keep it holy.

Six days shalt thou labor,
and do all thy work.

But the seventh day is a sabbath to YHVH thy Elohim.

In it thou shalt not do any work,
thou,
nor thy son,
nor thy daughter,
thy male servant,
nor thy maidservant,
nor thy cattle,
nor thy stranger who is within thy gates.

For in six days YHVH made heaven and earth,
the sea,
and all that is in them,
and rested on the seventh day.

Therefore YHVH blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

Honor thy father and thy mother:
that thy days may be long in the land
that YHVH thy Elohim is gives thee.

Thou shalt not murder.

Thou shalt not commit adultery.

Thou shalt not steal.

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house;
you shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife,
nor his manservant,
nor his maidservant,
nor his ox,
nor his ass,
nor anything that is thy neighbor's.
