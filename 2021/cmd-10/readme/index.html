  Remember the Sabbath day,
  to keep it holy.

  Six days shalt thou labor,
  and do all thy work.

  But the seventh day is a sabbath to YHVH thy Elohim.

  In it thou shalt not do any work,
  thou,
  nor thy son,
  nor thy daughter,
  thy male servant,
  nor thy maidservant,
  nor thy cattle,
  nor thy stranger who is within thy gates.

  For in six days YHVH made heaven and earth,
  the sea,
  and all that is in them,
  and rested on the seventh day.

  Therefore YHVH blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

  Honor thy father and thy mother:
  that thy days may be long in the land
  that YHVH thy Elohim is gives thee.

  Thou shalt not murder.

  Thou shalt not commit adultery.

  Thou shalt not steal.

  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house;
  you shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife,
  nor his manservant,
  nor his maidservant,
  nor his ox,
  nor his ass,
  nor anything that is thy neighbor's.
