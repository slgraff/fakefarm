# Name

It is easy to take names for granted because they are fundamental to our everyday living. A name is a brand, a reputation, and identifier.

One of the clues that Christianity is a false religion is that it does not respect this principal. It has taken a posture that a generic title is synonymous with a name. Even worse, it has adopted a different name than the name given to the Most High's Son. These are violations of the 3rd commandment.
