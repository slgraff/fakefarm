<h1>In the beginning was the word.</h1>

<p>Ever hear the fable of <em>the Tortoise and the Hare</em>? The animals decide to race, and against all logic and reasoning the tortoise wins the race.</p>

<p>I don't go slow because I dislike speed. I go slow because I want to win. I define winning as &quot;Living life the right way&quot;. The &quot;right way&quot; also happens to be a good way too. But before we get into topics such as morality, we need to slow down just a little bit more. </p>

<p>Being lost is never a good feeling. </p>

<p>My journey is not only a slow one, but a unique one. I was lost. I chose to invest a significant amount of my time going back to the beginning. I didn't know that I was supposed to return to the beginning </p>

<p>Winning to me is living In order to win you must learn the rules.</p>

<p>One such exercise that will seem slow is to in fact slow down to the point of understanding the diversity, creativity, and captivity that words are capable of. </p>

<h2>Words are a sword.</h2>
