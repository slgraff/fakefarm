# ðŸŒŠ ðŸ‘‹ Hello World

It took me 8 years before I realized the Internet is not a fad. I came into this place kicking and screaming. That was 2008. Before becoming a Senior Software Engineer I was an Art Director, Business Owner, Graphic Artist, T-shirt salesman with a MS in Finance, and BS in Communications. I have toured the corporate pie. Writing code and helping others do the same is my favorite of all forms of employment.
