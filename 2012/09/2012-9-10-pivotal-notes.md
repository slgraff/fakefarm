## Code Journal App

### Deploy Code-Journal to heroku
Thanks to Mike Gehard!

### Issue with local server after deployed;
1. Tried to rails server but got;

                /Users/dubipod/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194@code-journal/gems/sqlite3-1.3.6/lib/sqlite3/sqlite3_native.bundle: [BUG] Segmentation fault
                ruby 1.8.7 (2012-02-08 patchlevel 358) [universal-darwin12.0]

                Abort trap: 6


So, I got to [Segmentation fault with Ruby 1.8.7]()
which told me to ; _gem pristine --all_

That worked
