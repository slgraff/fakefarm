# Rspec

Domain specific language (DSL) for testing

## Level 1

### Installing

    gem install rspec

_In your project directory_

    rspec --init

### Describe Block

_The most basic is_

    describe Tweet do
    end

_A pending test_

uses 'it'

    describe Tweet do
        it "Can set status"
    end


_Create first test_

file will be named as such <name_of_spec>_spec.rb

        require 'spec_helper'
        describe 'A Zombie' do
            it "is named Ash"
        end

To run the file you type

    $ rspec (then/name/of/file_spec.rb)


More common version is to use the Class

      require 'spec_helper'
        describe Zombie do
            it "is named Ash"
        end

Since that test will fail, add the class to the file, then require that class

      require 'spec_helper'
      require 'zombie'
        describe Zombie do
            it "is named Ash"
        end
_This makes the test pending_

Add more info;

    describe Zombie do
    it 'is named Ash' do
    zombie = Zombie.new
    zombie.name.should == 'Ash' # <- That is an expectation.


### Modifiers & Matchers
Should is a modifier
Matcher is what you write to compare?

### Matchers

Matcher are what we want the test to be.

**Examples**
zombie.name.should == 'ash'
zombie.alive.shoul == false
*zombie.alive.should be_false*
*zombie.alive.should be_true*
*zombie.brains.should be < 1*
*zombie.height.should_not == 5*

### Testing a Predicate

    zombie.hungry?.should == true
    # is the same as
    zombie.hungry?.should be_tru
    # is the same as
    zombie.should be_hungry

### To mark as pending.

1. Leave off the do & end.
2. put an x before it -> xit
3. use pending keyword inside text




## Level 2 - Configuration & Matchers


### Installing in Rails

1. gem install rspec

2. rspec --init

_Then, adding to Rails_

1. Put in gem file

        group :development, :test do
            gem 'rspec-rails'
        end

2. Then, Bundle

3. Rails g rspec:install


### Output options

rspec --color

rspec --color --format
More verspose and nested examples


### Running specs
rspec

rspec spec/models/

rspec spec/models/zombie.spec

### Model Spec (slide 7)

### Matchers: Include

include is apart of checking to see if something is in an array.


### Matchers :Have

    describe Zombie do
      it 'starts with two weapons' do
        zombie = Zombie.new(name: "Ash")
        **zombie.weapoins.count.should == 2**
      end
    end

_Change the 'count.should == 2' to be more readable..._

    describe Zombie do
      it 'starts with two weapons' do
        zombie = Zombie.new(name: "Ash")
        zombie.should have(2).weapons
      end
    end

These will work too;
**have(n)**
**have_at_least(n)**
**have_at_most(n)**

### Matchers: change


## Level 3 DRY Specs

### Implicit Subject

    describe Zombie do
      it 'responds to name' do
        zombie = Zombie.new
        **zombie.should respond_to(:name)**
      end
    end

_Can be converted into_

    describe Zombie do
      it 'responds to name' do
        subject.should respond_to(:name)
      end
    end

_subject instatiates a new Zombie.new_
_Only works if your describe block has a class_
_Even more, 'subject' is implied so same code could be refactored down even more to._

    describe Zombie do
      it 'responds to name' do
        should respond_to(:name)
      end
    end

_You could simplify by using the {} instead of do & end, then remove duplication as well._

    describe Zombie do
      it { should respond_to(:name)}
    end


### its examples

_use its to simplify even more_

    describe Zombie do
      its(:name) {should == "Ash"}
    end


### Nesting Examples


### Context

### subject in context

### Using subject

### Let Keyword


### New Subject Syntax

    context 'with a veggie preference' do
     subject(:zombie) { Zombie.new(vegetarian: true, weapons: [axe]) }
     let (:axe) { Weapon.new(name: 'axe')}
