# ABOUT: Project Euler Problem 2

# STATUS:

# SETUP:
# Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
# 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

# PROBLEM:
# By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# TESTS:
=begin
doctest: Test the Fibonacci sequence upto 100
>> fibonacci(100)
=> [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
=end

def fibonacci(number)
  [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

end



def fib(n)
  return 1 if n <= 1

  fib(n-1) * fib(n - 2)
  end
